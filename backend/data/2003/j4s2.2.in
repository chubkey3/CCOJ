It is a sine
The time I spend
Is this a rhyme
Fine I am
It seems the glue my my my
is what holds my my my
the with with you by by by
is that the flu is by by by
It seems to me the glue that is by
Is the last this is going to try
ball all this by the by
is why we must try
I spend my timer
Looking for a dimer
It is a siner
I am finer
