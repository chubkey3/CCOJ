It is a siner
I spend my timer
Looking for a dimer
I am finer
Again it should rhyme
But I do not have the time
I enjoy lime
Except when they are orangey
Looking for a dimer
It is a siner
I spend my timer
I am finer
Life is fine
except with time
this cannot rhyme
but it doe
Why does it thou
you can say it
just say it
though tough thou flu
